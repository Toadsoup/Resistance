Resistance
==========

Small jquery app to determine resistor color band values. Not very exciting at the moment. Was an old project that I decided to start fixing and bringing up to speed.




Todo:  
Change direction (insert value, get band colors)  
Basic Code Cleanup  (refactor js, clean up html)   
CSS / JS Cleanup - update variable names & classes   
Design UI   
Generate Key / Guide  
Turn into jquery plugin (?)  

~~Apply tolerance Bands effect~~ (possible show values?)  
~~Abbreviate values to shorthand (1000 Ohms --> 1K Ohms)~~    
~~Update values given when all black~~
